## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-templates.git
cd claude-code-templates

# Create a new Claude Code project
python claude_setup.py my-awesome-project

# Navigate to your new project and start coding
cd my-awesome-project
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**That's it!** Your project now has:
- ✅ 5 specialized AI agents (MVP Planner, Architect, Code Reviewer, Test Runner, Debugger)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation templates  
- ✅ Security configurations and permissions
- ✅ Workflow optimization built-in
- ✅ Git-ready structure with proper .gitignore

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### The Problem
Every Claude Code project starts the same way: 
- Manual creation of project structure
- Repetitive agent configuration
- Documentation template setup
- Security permission configuration
- Workflow optimization research

**Result**: 30-45 minutes of setup time before you can focus on actual development.

### The Solution
This automation script implements the **80/20 rule** for Claude Code success: 80% of effectiveness comes from upfront strategy and structured context management, not clever prompts.

### The Impact
```
Manual Setup:     30-45 minutes per project
Automated Setup:  2-3 minutes per project
Time Saved:       90%+ reduction in setup time
Quality Gain:     Research-backed best practices built-in
```

## 🏗️ What Gets Created

The script generates a complete, production-ready project structure:

## 💡 Key Features

### 🤖 Five Specialized Agents
Based on Chris Dunlop's proven workflow, each agent has specific expertise:

- **MVP Planner**: Converts vague goals into crisp, actionable scope
- **Architect**: Maintains design consistency and makes sound technical decisions  
- **Code Reviewer**: Performs comprehensive quality and security reviews
- **Test Runner**: Automates testing workflows and coverage analysis
- **Debugger**: Handles systematic debugging and issue resolution

### 📚 Research-Based Documentation
Every template incorporates best practices from successful Claude Code workflows:

- **Scope Definition**: Clear project boundaries and success metrics
- **Decision Logging**: Architecture decision records (ADRs) with rationale
- **Task Management**: Sprint planning and backlog organization
- **Workflow Guidance**: Team playbooks for consistent collaboration

### 🔒 Security First
Built-in security configurations protect sensitive data:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)", 
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Read(./config/credentials.json)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 🎯 Context Optimization
Implements proven strategies for maximizing Claude's effectiveness:

- **CLAUDE.md** kept under 200 lines for optimal token usage
- **File referencing** with `@filepath` to minimize context bloat
- **Agent specialization** to provide focused expertise
- **Progressive complexity** in documentation structure

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Create project in current directory
python claude_setup.py project-name

# Create project in specific location
python claude_setup.py my-api --path ~/development/

# Get help
python claude_setup.py --help
```

### Advanced Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   python claude_setup.py advanced-saas-app --path ~/projects/
   cd ~/projects/advanced-saas-app
   ```

2. **Customize Your Project**
   - Edit `docs/01-scope.md` with your specific project goals
   - Update `docs/architecture-design.md` with your technical stack
   - Modify `CLAUDE.md` to include essential project context

3. **Start Claude Code Session**
   ```bash
   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
   claude "Please read @CLAUDE.md and @docs/architecture-design.md to understand this project"
   ```

4. **Use the Specialized Agents**
   ```bash
   claude "Act as @.claude/agents/mvp-planner.md and help me plan the user authentication feature"
   claude "Act as @.claude/agents/architect.md and review this database schema design"
   claude "Act as @.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md and review my API implementation"
   ```

## 🔄 Optimal Workflow

The script sets up the **Explore-Plan-Code-Commit** workflow proven to maximize Claude Code effectiveness:

### 1. Explore Phase
```bash
claude "Read @docs/03-tasks.md and show me current sprint priorities"
claude "Examine the existing codebase structure for the user management module"
```

### 2. Plan Phase  
```bash
claude "Act as @.claude/agents/mvp-planner.md and create a detailed plan for [feature]"
claude "Act as @.claude/agents/architect.md and validate this implementation approach"
```

### 3. Code Phase
```bash
claude "Implement [feature] following our architecture in @docs/architecture-design.md"  
claude "Ensure the code follows our established patterns and conventions"
```

### 4. Commit Phase
```bash
claude "Act as @.claude/agents/test-runner.md and create comprehensive tests"
claude "Act as @.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md and perform final review"
```
